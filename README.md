# Role Manager for Android.

This module is to be installed as a system level component and works to assign/revoke roles from apps.

It needs the custom Android 10 SDK to work, will not work on stock Android 10 SDKs.

This is a broad overview of how this module fits into the Android platform architecture. The items in red color are developed by me.
